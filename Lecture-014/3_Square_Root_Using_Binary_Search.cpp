// The issue with your code is in the conditions inside the while loop. 
// Specifically, the else statement, which is meant to return mid when square == x, 
// is placed after both if conditions. This means that when square == x, it first checks square >= x, 
// which causes end to be adjusted, and it doesn't return immediately.

// Corrected Code:

// To fix this, you should handle the square == x case directly with an else if rather than a separate else. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the code:
